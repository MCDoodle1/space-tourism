## My process

I first examined the page layout of the different versions (mobile, tablet and desktop) and divided it into sections. These sections became the basis for the React components (Navbar, Hero, Title, etc.). From this I decided to use CSS Grids. I viewed the Scrimba training by Kevin Powel and created the basic CSS styling. Then I styled every component with the help of the Figma file from the course. After this I added the functionality with React JS and tweeked the styling.

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Responsive design
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

I learned a lot of new CSS from the course and used the Router/Navlink component in React. I also learned to use UseLocation and created a custom hook.

It was quite a challenge to deploy the code on GitHub pages. I had to change the router
from BrowserRouter to HashRouter for the navigation to work.

### Continued development

Extend my knowledge of HTML, CSS and React.
